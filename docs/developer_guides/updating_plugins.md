# Updating Plugins

This page aims to help with porting a SeAT plugin to a newer version of seat.

## From SeAT 4
SeAT 5 mainly upgrades the php and laravel version as well as all dependencies to their newest version. However, there are a few other breaking changes that can't be ignored.

- PHP 8.2: SeAT now runs on php 8.2, enabling new features like enums and better type hinting, but also breaking a few things.
- Route Prefixing: All routes from the seat core start with `seatcore::`. For example, `notifications.integrations.list` turns into `seatcore::notifications.integrations.list`. If your plugin uses routes pointing to the seat core, you will have to update them.
- Models: With SeAT 5, the `services` packages starts to ship a `ExtensibleModel` class. Plugins can inject relation into these models, fo example from an eveapi model to a plugin model. 
  It is recommended that all models start extending from `\Seat\Services\Models\ExtensibleModel`. It is enough to just switch from `MyClass extend Model` to `MyClass extends ExtensibleModel`
- Notifications: All notifications from SeAT 4 continue to work, but by updating them you can enable more features like discord pings. See the [notifications guide](notifications_implementation.md) for more details.
- The `Seat\Eveapi\Jobs\Middleware\WithoutOverlapping` job middleware backport is now provided by laravel and got removed from the SeAT core. Use `Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\WithoutOverlapping` instead. Just swapping the import should be enough, as they are compatible.
- Some, but not all ways of exporting data from DataTables are broken. Just check whether they work and fix if required.
- There are a few minor breaking changes between Laravel 6 and 10:
  - `MyJob::dispatchNow()` got replaced with `MyJob::dispatchSync()`
  - For a full list, head over to the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/upgrade).

## From SeAT 3

If you're upgrading a SeAT 3.x plugin, the cheat sheet bellow will probably helps you.

Also, if you need it, a table called `mig_groups` is available in database containing a list of all converted group into standalone user.
This table will stay here until next SeAT major update.
